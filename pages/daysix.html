"Count your age by friends, not years. Count your life by smiles, not tears." 
<p>
"The more I see, the less I know for sure."
<p>
"A dream you dream alone is only a dream. A dream you dream together is reality." 
<p>
"One thing you can't hide - is when you're crippled inside."
<p>
"There's nowhere you can be that isn't where you're meant to be..." 
<p>
"Living is Easy with Eyes Closed." 
<p>
"As usual, there is a great woman behind every idiot."

 "Reality leaves a lot to the imagination."
